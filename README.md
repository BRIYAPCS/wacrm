The marketing site and self-host docs live in a separate repo:
[ArnasDon/wacrm-site](https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm-site)
([wacrm.tech](https://wacrm.tech)). This repo is the product —
clone or fork it to run your own CRM.

## What you get out of the box

- **Shared inbox** on the official WhatsApp Business API — multiple
  agents working one number, per-conversation assignment, status, and
  notes.
- **Contacts + tags + custom fields**, CSV import, deduplication.
- **Sales pipelines** (Kanban) with deals linked to conversations.
- **Broadcasts** with Meta-approved templates, delivery + read
  tracking, per-recipient variable substitution.
- **No-code automations** — triggers on inbound messages, new
  contacts, keywords, or schedule; conditional branches, waits,
  tags, webhooks. Visual builder.
- **AI reply assistant** — bring your own key for **any provider**:
  OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq,
  DeepSeek, Mistral, Together, xAI, Zhipu GLM, or a **self-hosted /
  OpenAI-compatible** endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM…). Keys are
  stored encrypted — no per-seat AI fee, your data stays yours.
  One-click AI-drafted replies in the inbox, plus an optional
  auto-reply bot with a per-conversation cap and clean human handoff.
  Add a **knowledge base** and it answers from your own content —
  typed FAQs/policies, **uploaded documents** (PDF, Word, text), or a
  **website URL** the server reads for you. Hybrid retrieval (Postgres
  full-text, or semantic pgvector when an embeddings key is set). See
  [docs/ai-assistant.md](./docs/ai-assistant.md).
- **Real-time dashboard** — response times, daily volume, pipeline
  value, cross-module activity feed.
- **Team accounts** — **invite-only** onboarding: the first user on a
  fresh instance becomes the owner, and everyone else joins by **emailed
  invitation** with role-based access (owner / admin / agent / viewer) and
  ownership transfer. Random emails can't self-register (enforced in the
  database). One shared, account-scoped inbox staffed by a whole team.
- **Account management** — email, password, avatar, global sign-out.
- **Public REST API** (`/api/v1`) with scoped, revocable API keys —
  build your own automations on top of your CRM. See
  [docs/public-api.md](./docs/public-api.md).

## Why fork this?

This is a **template**, not a product. Forking means you get:

- **Full ownership** — your code, your Supabase project, your domain,
  your data. No SaaS lock-in, no seat pricing, no trust dance.
- **Full customisation** — add the fields your team needs, remove the
  modules you don't, redesign anything. The stack is boring on
  purpose (Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind) so the learning curve is
  short.
- **Zero ops to start** — [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/web-apps-hosting)
  Managed Node.js deploys a fork in a few clicks. No Docker, no
  Kubernetes, no infra team needed.
  ([See below ↓](#-deploy-on-hostinger-recommended))
- **Real security primitives** — token encryption (AES-256-GCM), RLS
  on every table, HMAC-verified webhooks, CSP, rate limiting, CI
  typecheck/build on every PR.

Not a framework. Not an SDK. A concrete, working CRM you can stand up
in an afternoon and make yours.

## Quick start

```bash
# Fork on GitHub first: https://github.com/ArnasDon/wacrm → Fork
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/wacrm.git
cd wacrm
npm install
npm run setup       # scaffolds .env + generates ENCRYPTION_KEY/cron secret
#                     then open .env and paste your Supabase + Meta creds
npm run db:deploy   # apply all DB migrations → your Supabase project
npm run dev
```

`npm run setup` creates `.env`, generates the secrets you shouldn't
hand-pick, and reports which values are still missing. `npm run db:deploy`
then applies every migration in `supabase/migrations/` (idempotent,
re-runnable) — it needs `SUPABASE_DB_URL`.

Open <http://localhost:3000> → `/login`. The **first sign-up becomes the
owner** (sign-up is invite-only thereafter).

> **Standing up a real deployment — or a new customer instance?** Follow
> **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)**: the complete, self-contained
> zero-to-live guide (Supabase, migrations, SMTP for invites, WhatsApp,
> cron, domain). Per-customer redeploys have a tight
> [checklist](./docs/new-customer-checklist.md).

**wacrm is built to run on [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/web-apps-hosting).**
It's the path we test, document, and recommend — and the fastest way
to get a production-grade CRM live without owning a VPS or a
Kubernetes cluster.

### Why Hostinger?

| | |
|---|---|
| **One-click Git deploy** | Connect your fork, push to `main`, Hostinger builds and ships it. No SSH, no Docker, no CI to wire up — this repo's own `main` deploys this way. |
| **Managed Node.js** | Next.js 16 (App Router, server actions, ISR) runs out of the box on [Premium, Business, and Cloud](https://www.hostinger.com/web-apps-hosting) shared plans. You don't manage Node versions, processes, or reverse proxies. |
| **Free SSL + free domain** | Automatic Let's Encrypt on your custom domain (or a free one included with annual plans). HTTPS is on by default — required for the WhatsApp Business webhook. |
| **Global CDN + LiteSpeed** | Static assets cached at the edge, dynamic routes served from LiteSpeed. Snappy dashboards out of the box, no Cloudflare setup required. |
| **Env vars + logs in hPanel** | Set `SUPABASE_*`, `WHATSAPP_*`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from the panel — no `.env` on the server. Live application logs in the same UI. |
| **DDoS protection + daily backups** | Built-in, no add-ons. The webhook endpoint is a public target — having protection at the edge matters. |
| **Cheaper than a VPS** | Plans start at a few dollars a month — order-of-magnitude less than a comparable managed Node.js host, and you don't pay extra for the database (that's Supabase). |
| **24/7 human support** | Live chat support in 20+ languages — useful when your CRM is the thing your team relies on to talk to customers. |

### The 60-second version

1. **Fork** this repo on GitHub.
2. In **hPanel → Websites → Create**, pick **Node.js** and connect
   your fork.
3. Paste your Supabase + Meta env vars into hPanel.
4. Push to `main`. Hostinger builds and serves it. Done.

> _Note: wacrm is MIT-licensed and runs anywhere Node.js does
> (Vercel, Railway, your own VPS). Hostinger is recommended, not
> required._

## Contributing

This is a template, not a collaborative product — the expected flow is
fork → customise → deploy, **not** upstream contribution. Bug reports
and security issues are welcome; feature PRs often belong in your fork
rather than here. Details in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[`.github/SECURITY.md`](./.github/SECURITY.md).
